## **Active Project**

### [Learning Project](./learning-project/README.md)

This project focuses on foundational Kubernetes and Terraform skills, divided into four structured phases:
- **Phase 0:** Organization and Planning
- **Phase 1:** Foundations of Kubernetes
- **Phase 2:** Terraform Basics
- **Phase 3:** Scaling and Resilience

Explore the [Learning Project README](./learning-project/README.md) for detailed instructions.
