# **Learning Kubernetes with Cluster and Terraform**

Welcome to the **Learning-Kubernetes-Cluster-Terraform** repository! This repository serves as the central hub for building foundational Kubernetes and Terraform skills while preparing for advanced modular subprojects.

---

## **Active Project**

### [Learning Project](./learning-project/README.md)

This project focuses on foundational Kubernetes and Terraform skills, divided into four structured phases:
- **Phase 0:** Organization and Planning
- **Phase 1:** Foundations of Kubernetes
- **Phase 2:** Terraform Basics

Explore the [Learning Project README](./learning-project/README.md) for detailed instructions.

## **Future Subprojects**

As you progress, the repository will expand into modular subprojects for advanced topics:

| **Subproject Name**                  | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **[Production-Grade Deployments](./future-projects/production-grade-deployments/README.md)**     | Focus on scaling, resilience, and real-world Kubernetes setups.                 |
| **[Monitoring and Observability](./future-projects/monitoring-and-observability/README.md)**     | Includes Prometheus, Grafana, and centralized logging setups.                   |
| **[Advanced Kubernetes Features](./future-projects/advanced-kubernetes-features/README.md)**     | Covers RBAC, Network Policies, Service Mesh, and multi-cluster setups.          |

# Learning Kubernetes and Terraform

This repository is organized into two main sections:

## **1. Learning Project**
A hands-on, phased approach to learning Kubernetes and Terraform, starting from the basics.

### Phases
| Phase    | Description                                     | Path                              |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Phase 0  | Organization and Planning                      | `learning-project/phase0/`      |
| Phase 1  | Foundations of Kubernetes                      | `learning-project/phase1/`      |
| Phase 2  | Terraform Basics                               | `learning-project/phase2/`      |
