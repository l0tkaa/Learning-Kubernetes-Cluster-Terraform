# **Learning Kubernetes with Cluster and Terraform**

Welcome to the **Learning-Kubernetes-Cluster-Terraform** repository! This repository serves as the central hub for building foundational Kubernetes and Terraform skills while preparing for advanced modular subprojects.

---

## **Active Project**

### [Learning Project](./learning-project/README.md)

This project focuses on foundational Kubernetes and Terraform skills, divided into four structured phases:
- **Phase 0:** Organization and Planning
- **Phase 1:** Foundations of Kubernetes
- **Phase 2:** Terraform Basics
- **Phase 3:** Scaling and Resilience

Explore the [Learning Project README](./learning-project/README.md) for detailed instructions.

## **Future Subprojects**

As you progress, the repository will expand into modular subprojects for advanced topics:

| **Subproject Name**                  | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **[Production-Grade Deployments](./future-projects/production-grade-deployments/README.md)**     | Focus on scaling, resilience, and real-world Kubernetes setups.                 |
| **[Monitoring and Observability](./future-projects/monitoring-and-observability/README.md)**     | Includes Prometheus, Grafana, and centralized logging setups.                   |
| **[Advanced Kubernetes Features](./future-projects/advanced-kubernetes-features/README.md)**     | Covers RBAC, Network Policies, Service Mesh, and multi-cluster setups.          |

This subproject focuses on deploying real-world, production-grade Kubernetes applications.

---

### Planned Phases

1. **Phase 4:** Multi-Tier Applications
   - Deploy frontend-backend-database applications.
2. **Phase 5:** CI/CD Pipelines
   - Automate deployments with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

---

## **Monitoring and Observability**

This subproject explores monitoring, metrics, and centralized logging for Kubernetes clusters.

---

### **Planned Phases**

1. **Phase 6:** Prometheus and Grafana
   - Monitor metrics and create dashboards.
2. **Phase 7:** Centralized Logging
   - Set up the Elasticsearch-Fluentd-Kibana (EFK) stack.



## **Advanced Kubernetes Features**

This subproject focuses on advanced Kubernetes configurations and practices.

---

### **Planned Phases**

1. **Phase 8:** Security and Policies
   - Implement RBAC, Network Policies, and Pod Security Policies.
