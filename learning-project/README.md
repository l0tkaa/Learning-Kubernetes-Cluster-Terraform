# My Kubernetes and Terraform Learning Journey (Phases 0–2)

## Why I'm Doing This

This project is my way of learning Kubernetes and Terraform by actually doing the work. I want to move from knowing concepts to confidently using these tools in real-world scenarios.

---

## Goal

Learn how to:
- Understand and use Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications.
- Automate Kubernetes resources using Terraform.
- Build practical skills I can apply to future projects.

---

## Phases

### [**Phase 0: Organization and Planning**](./phase0/phase-0)
- Set up a structure for the project.
- Organize a clear roadmap with tasks and milestones.
- Gather resources and tools to stay focused.

### [**Phase 1: Foundations of Kubernetes**](./phase1/phase-1)
- Learn Kubernetes basics by setting up a local cluster.
- Deploy a simple Nginx application and practice scaling it.
- Use core Kubernetes resources: Pods, Deployments, and Services.

### [**Phase 2: Terraform Basics**](./phase2/phase-2)
- Learn Terraform by automating Kubernetes resources.
- Write Terraform configurations for clusters, Deployments, and Services.
- Practice managing infrastructure with Terraform commands.

## Next Steps

After Phase 2, I’ll decide whether to focus on scaling clusters, monitoring, or more advanced Kubernetes topics.

## Why This Matters

This is for me to document my learning journey, stay organized, and build confidence in using Kubernetes and Terraform step-by-step.
